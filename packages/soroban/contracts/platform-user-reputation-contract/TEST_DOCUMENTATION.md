# User Reputation Contract Test Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and coverage for the User Reputation Contract. The tests are designed to verify the contract's functionality, validation mechanisms, and error handling. The test suite ensures that user registration, expertise management, reputation scoring, and user queries work correctly while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Security and Validation

The test suite focuses on several key security aspects:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Tests verify that only authorized users can perform restricted operations
   - Ensures proper authentication for user profile updates
   - Validates that reputation updates follow proper authorization rules

2. **Input Validation**
   - Tests validate that user inputs meet required format and constraints
   - Ensures expertise areas are properly formatted and validated
   - Verifies reputation score changes are properly validated

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Verifies that user data is correctly stored and retrieved
   - Ensures reputation scores are accurately calculated and updated
   - Tests that expertise areas are properly managed and maintained

4. **Error Handling**
   - Tests proper error responses for invalid operations
   - Ensures descriptive error messages for debugging
   - Verifies graceful handling of edge cases

## Test Coverage (Exhaustive Analysis)

### 1. User Registration Tests

- **Basic Registration**
  - Tests successful user registration with valid parameters
  - Verifies user data is correctly stored
  - Tests registration with various expertise areas
  - Ensures proper event emission for user registration

- **Registration Validation**
  - Tests duplicate registration handling
  - Verifies validation of user address format
  - Tests validation of expertise area format
  - Ensures proper error handling for invalid registrations

- **Registration Queries**
  - Tests `is_registered` function with registered and unregistered users
  - Verifies user count is correctly updated after registration
  - Tests retrieval of all users after multiple registrations
  - Ensures recent users are correctly filtered by timestamp

### 2. Expertise Management Tests

- **Expertise Updates**
  - Tests updating expertise areas for registered users
  - Verifies expertise data is correctly updated in storage
  - Tests updating with empty expertise list
  - Ensures proper event emission for expertise updates

- **Expertise Addition**
  - Tests adding individual expertise areas to user profiles
  - Verifies duplicate expertise areas are handled correctly
  - Tests adding expertise to non-existent users
  - Ensures proper event emission for expertise additions

- **Expertise Removal**
  - Tests removing expertise areas from user profiles
  - Verifies removal of non-existent expertise areas
  - Tests removing expertise from non-existent users
  - Ensures proper event emission for expertise removals

### 3. Reputation System Tests

- **Reputation Updates**
  - Tests updating reputation with positive score deltas
  - Tests updating reputation with negative score deltas
  - Verifies reputation score is correctly calculated
  - Tests updating reputation for non-existent users
  - Ensures proper event emission for reputation updates

- **Reputation Reset**
  - Tests resetting individual user reputation
  - Verifies reputation is correctly set to zero
  - Tests resetting reputation for non-existent users
  - Ensures proper event emission for reputation resets

- **System-wide Reset**
  - Tests resetting all user reputations
  - Verifies all reputations are correctly set to zero
  - Tests system behavior with empty user list
  - Ensures proper event emission for system-wide resets

### 4. User Management Tests

- **User Retrieval**
  - Tests retrieving user profiles with `get_user`
  - Verifies all user data is correctly returned
  - Tests retrieving non-existent users
  - Ensures consistency between stored and retrieved data

- **User Removal**
  - Tests removing individual users
  - Verifies user data is completely removed from storage
  - Tests removing non-existent users
  - Ensures proper event emission for user removals

- **System-wide User Management**
  - Tests retrieving all users with `get_all_users`
  - Tests retrieving recent users with `get_recent_users`
  - Verifies user count with `get_user_count`
  - Tests removing all users with `remove_all_users`
  - Ensures proper event emission for system-wide operations

### 5. Integration Tests

- **End-to-End Workflows**
  - Tests complete user lifecycle (registration, expertise updates, reputation changes, removal)
  - Verifies interaction between different contract functions
  - Tests complex scenarios with multiple users and operations
  - Ensures proper state transitions throughout workflows

- **Edge Cases**
  - Tests system behavior with maximum values
  - Verifies handling of concurrent operations
  - Tests system recovery from error states
  - Ensures proper handling of unusual sequences of operations

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Add more tests for edge cases in reputation calculation
   - Implement property-based testing for complex operations
   - Add stress tests with large numbers of users

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Add more tests for authorization boundaries
   - Implement role-based access control tests
   - Test contract ownership and administrative functions

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Expand tests for integration with other Akkuea contracts
   - Test interaction with the contributor-reputation-contract
   - Implement cross-contract workflow testing

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Add benchmarks for key operations
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Optimize based on performance test results
