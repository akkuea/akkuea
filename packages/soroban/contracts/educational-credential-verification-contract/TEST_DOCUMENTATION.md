# Educator Verification NFT Contract Test Documentation

## Test Strategy Overview

The test strategy for the Educator Verification NFT Contract focuses on ensuring the integrity, security, and functionality of the educator verification system. Tests should verify that educators can be registered, credentials can be verified, NFTs are properly issued, and the review system functions correctly.

## Security and Validation Focus

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Admin Authorization**: Verify that only the designated administrator can perform administrative functions.
- **Reviewer Authorization**: Ensure that only authorized reviewers can verify credentials and submit reviews.
- **Educator Authentication**: Confirm that educators can only modify their own profiles.

### Credential Validation

- **Hash Format Validation**: Test that credential hash formats are properly validated.
- **Digital Signature Verification**: Verify that digital signatures are correctly checked.
- **Institution Verification**: Ensure that credentials are verified against authorized institutions.

### NFT Security

- **NFT Issuance Control**: Verify that NFTs are only issued to properly verified educators.
- **NFT Burning**: Ensure that NFTs are properly burned when verification is revoked.

### Review System Integrity

- **Rating Validation**: Test that ratings must be within the valid range (1-10).
- **Reviewer Authentication**: Verify that only authorized reviewers can submit reviews.
- **Rating Calculation**: Ensure that average ratings are calculated correctly.

## Test Coverage

### Initialization Tests

- Test contract initialization with a valid administrator
- Test that initialization can only be performed once
- Test initialization with invalid parameters

### Educator Registration Tests

- Test successful educator registration with valid parameters
- Test registration with invalid parameters (empty name, invalid credentials)
- Test duplicate registration prevention
- Test registration event emission

### Reviewer Management Tests

- Test adding a reviewer as administrator
- Test removing a reviewer as administrator
- Test unauthorized reviewer addition attempts
- Test reviewer list retrieval

### Credential Verification Tests

- Test successful credential verification with valid parameters
- Test verification with invalid hash formats
- Test verification with invalid digital signatures
- Test verification against unauthorized institutions
- Test verification by unauthorized reviewers

### Educator Profile Management Tests

- Test successful profile updates by educators
- Test unauthorized profile update attempts
- Test adding new credentials to existing profiles
- Test profile retrieval functions

### NFT Issuance Tests

- Test NFT minting upon successful verification
- Test NFT metadata correctness (verification level, specialties)
- Test NFT ownership assignment
- Test NFT burning upon verification revocation

### Review System Tests

- Test successful review submission by authorized reviewers
- Test review submission with invalid ratings
- Test review submission by unauthorized reviewers
- Test review retrieval functions
- Test average rating calculation

### Verification Level Tests

- Test verification level calculation based on ratings
- Test verification level updates after new reviews
- Test initial verification level assignment

### Search and Discovery Tests

- Test retrieval of verified educators
- Test retrieval of educators by specialty
- Test empty result handling

### Edge Case Tests

- Test behavior with zero reviews
- Test behavior with maximum rating values
- Test behavior with minimum rating values
- Test behavior with large numbers of credentials
- Test behavior with large numbers of specialties

### Revocation Tests

- Test successful verification revocation by administrator
- Test unauthorized revocation attempts
- Test revocation of non-verified educators
- Test NFT burning during revocation
- Test revocation reason storage

## Integration Tests

### Cross-Contract Integration

- Test integration with NFT standards
- Test integration with other Akkuea ecosystem contracts

### End-to-End Workflows

- Test complete educator lifecycle (registration, verification, review, level change, revocation)
- Test reviewer lifecycle (addition, verification activities, removal)

## Suggested Test Expansion

### Fuzz Testing

- Implement property-based tests for credential verification
- Test with randomly generated educator profiles
- Test with randomly generated review patterns

### Temporal Testing

- Test time-based verification expiration
- Test review freshness weighting

### Performance Testing

- Test with large numbers of educators
- Test with large numbers of reviews
- Test with large numbers of credentials

### Concurrency Testing

- Test simultaneous verification requests
- Test simultaneous review submissions
- Test race conditions in verification status updates

### Upgrade Testing

- Test contract upgrades and data migration
- Test backward compatibility with previous versions

## Running Tests

```bash
cd packages/soroban/contracts/educator-verification-nft
cargo test
```

For specific test categories:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture test_initialization
cargo test -- --nocapture test_verification
cargo test -- --nocapture test_reviews
```

## Test Coverage Metrics

The test suite should aim for:

- 100% coverage of public functions
- 100% coverage of authorization checks
- 100% coverage of error conditions
- 95%+ coverage of edge cases
- 90%+ coverage of integration scenarios

## Continuous Integration

Tests should be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure:

- All tests pass before merging changes
- No regressions are introduced
- Test coverage remains high
- Security checks are performed automatically

## Security Audit Recommendations

Beyond automated tests, the contract should undergo:

- Formal verification of critical functions
- Manual code review by security experts
- Penetration testing of authorization mechanisms
- Audit of NFT implementation compliance
