# Contributor Reputation Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Contributor Reputation Contract is a Soroban-based smart contract built for the Stellar blockchain that enables the management of user reputation, expertise verification, and credential issuance within the Akkuea ecosystem. This system allows users to build verifiable reputations in specific subject areas, have their expertise validated, and receive non-transferable credential tokens that verify their identity and contributions.

The contract serves as a trust layer for the educational platform, ensuring that contributors' expertise and contributions are properly recognized, verified, and rewarded. By maintaining a transparent and immutable record of user reputations, the contract facilitates trust between content creators, educators, and learners in the ecosystem.
