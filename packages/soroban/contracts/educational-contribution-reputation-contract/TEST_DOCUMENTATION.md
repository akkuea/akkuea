# Contributor Reputation Contract Test Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and coverage for the Contributor Reputation Contract. The tests are designed to verify the contract's functionality, validation mechanisms, and error handling. The test suite ensures that user registration, reputation scoring, expertise verification, and credential management work correctly while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Security and Validation

The test suite focuses on several key security aspects:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Tests verify that only authorized users can perform restricted operations
   - Ensures proper authentication for user profile updates
   - Validates that only authorized verifiers can verify expertise
   - Tests that only authorized issuers can issue credentials

2. **Input Validation**
   - Tests validate that user inputs meet required format and constraints
   - Ensures reputation scores are within valid ranges
   - Verifies expertise levels are properly validated
   - Tests edge cases for all input parameters

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Verifies that user data is correctly stored and retrieved
   - Ensures reputation scores are accurately calculated and updated
   - Tests that expertise claims and verifications maintain consistency
   - Validates credential issuance and revocation processes

4. **Error Handling**
   - Tests proper error responses for invalid operations
   - Ensures descriptive error messages for debugging
   - Verifies graceful handling of edge cases
   - Tests error propagation through the contract
