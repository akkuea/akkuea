# Milestone Finance Contract with Reputation System Integration

A Soroban smart contract that implements a reputation-based voting system for project funding decisions, tracking creator success rates and applying reputation-based voting power.

## üéØ Objective

    score: u32,            // Reputation score (0-100)
    projects_completed: u32, // Number of successfully completed projects
    milestones_missed: u32,  // Number of missed milestones
    total_projects: u32,     // Total number of projects participated in
    last_updated: u64,       // Timestamp of last reputation update
}
```

### User

```rust
struct User {
    id: u64,

    name: String,
    reputation: Reputation,
    created_at: u64,
}
```

### ProjectVote

```rust
struct ProjectVote {
    project_id: u64,
