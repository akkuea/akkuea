# Educational Content Tipping Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Educational Content Tipping Contract is a specialized smart contract designed to facilitate and track monetary appreciation for educational content creators within the Akkuea ecosystem. It enables users to send tips to educators as a form of recognition and financial support for valuable educational content. The contract maintains comprehensive statistics about tipping activities, tracks tip history, and identifies top-performing educators based on the tips they receive.

This contract serves as an incentive mechanism that encourages the creation of high-quality educational content by providing a direct channel for monetary appreciation between learners and educators. It implements a transparent and efficient tipping system that records all transactions, maintains educator statistics, and provides visibility into the most appreciated educators in the ecosystem.

The contract includes features for tip management, educator statistics tracking, tip history recording, and top educator ranking. It also implements proper authorization checks, input validation, and event emission for transparency and auditability.

## Events

The contract emits the following events:

1. `tip` - Emitted when a tip is sent
   - Topics: "tip", sender_address, recipient_address
   - Data: amount, token_address, optional_message, timestamp

2. `educator_stats_updated` - Emitted when educator statistics are updated
   - Topics: "educator_stats_updated", educator_address
   - Data: total_tips, tip_count
